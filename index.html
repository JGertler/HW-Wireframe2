<h2> About Me </h2>
<img id="bio-image" src="jgBioPic.jpg" alt="Jessica Gertler" ALIGN=bottom> <p> I have a germ of an idea, so I am taking coding boot camp so I can pursue that idea. Moreover, coding will be the first definitive skill I can probably put on my resume, so that's cool. I am finding that as I learn more and more to code, including within this assignment, I must say I actually enjoy the struggle. Or, rather, the struggle feels worth my time, so again, that's cool. My cat's on my lap as I write this, making it very difficult. </p>
<br>

<p> As said by the homework example, "Jelly-o cheescake dessert fruitcake ice cream brownie liquorice soofle (too lazy to find the correct "e"), caramels biscuit etc."  Personally, I would've said myself: "Watermelon chocolate dried fruits chocolate chip cookies hiphop dance animals cacti orange pink blue all the colors painting drawing yoga occasional sushi attempted vegan more cats more dogs and more spreading of kindness and especially cajun breakfast." </p>
